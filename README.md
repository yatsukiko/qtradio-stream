# qtradio-stream
Commands available: 

**qtradio** - Start playback of qtradio.moe/stream at 100% volume, you can change volume on first argument and on second argument change bitrate to 320, 192, 96 or to a different source(direct links only). Using this command again will restart playback.

**qtpause** - Pauses radio, not mute, therefore after you resume it will be at same moment and delayed from current live stream.

**qtresume, qtplay** - Resumes from pause.

**qtmute** - Toggles mute, a better pause as it doesn't introduce delay from live stream. 

**qtvolume** - Changes volume from 1-100 if no argument is added will instead make clyde say what volume you are at.

**qtnp** - Makes clyde say what song is currently playing at qtradio, remember if you have used qtpause you will be delayed and qtnp may not show the song you are currently listening to. If argument "send" is added will make you say current song in channel you are typing. It also doesn't work with custom source on qtradio command.
